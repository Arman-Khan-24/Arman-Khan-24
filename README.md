Hi there! I'm Arman Khan !

I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Priyadarshini College of Engineering, Nagpur, set to graduate in 2027. I'm passionate about technology and currently honing my skills through a virtual internship at Tech-A-Intern. Recently, I clinched the 1st rank at "Momentum," a prestigious poster making competition hosted by Priyadarshini College of Engineering, Nagpur.

My expertise includes coding in C++, ongoing exploration of data structures and algorithms, and mastery in Microsoft Excel. I'm always eager to learn and grow, seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.

Let's follow each other and explore possibilities together!
